# ActiveMemory.MnesiaManager 
The overall conecept of this application is to abstract away the mnesia disk persistance along with schema management while using ActiveMemory.
The goal is to allow applications using horizontal scaling to connect into an mnesia cluster, disconnect from the cluster, and reconnect again to the cluster easily.

This app was designed to be run with [ActiveMemory](https://hex.pm/packages/active_memory) 
as part of a demo or production.

Please see the [BeamDemo](https://github.com/SullysMustyRuby/BeamDemo) for general instructions and use.
